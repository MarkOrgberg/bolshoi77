      <h1>The Leningrad Blockade</h1>
      <p>
        The tenants of flat five were, of course, also affected by the Blockade (Siege) of Leningrad, which lasted from 8th September 1941 to 27th January 1944. 1.1 million of the city’s inhabitants died in these horrible months and years, most of them from hunger.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the war, sisters, children, grandchildren, and the hostess's best friend took refuge in the room. They put a cooker in the middle of the room, with a chimney leading from it to the fireplace. It was warmer that way, and it was possible to cook without leaving the room. After the blockade, only three paintings, a few books, and crockery were left; everything else — furniture, books, etc. — was burnt or exchanged for food.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such conditions, Haya-Rohl took care of her grandson, who was left an orphan. Other family members were evacuated: the pregnant Lia, a laboratory physician, had the luck to be in one of the last trains escaping the besieged city. Her husband Mihoel, a pharmacist, stayed in Leningrad. There, he once moved a dead body aside and infected himself, which made him very ill. He would have died if not for a friend who by chance came by and nursed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In spring of 1942, after the first and harshest winter, Mihoel was also evacuated and found his wife and already born small daughter Rimma in Bashkiria, many thousand kilometers east of Leningrad.

        For their relatives left behind in the city and in flat 5, it was a hard time: Some of the men were killed in action defending the city, the others survived with a bare minimum of bread provided by the authorities. Asya, the wife of Boris, the oldest son of Dovid-Irme and Haya-Rohl, worked in the bacteriological laboratory of a bread factory and was later awarded the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad."
      </p>
      <p>
        At some moment, someone found a huge jar of marmalade somewhere in the flat which helped them survive the first, the harshest hunger winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also casualties: The husband of Manya, the youngest sister of Boris and Lia, was killed in action defending the city. She died from starvation shortly after the end of the war, leaving her son David an orphan to be raised by his grandmother and his uncle.
