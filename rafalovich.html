    <h1>Adolf Rafalovich</h1>
    <p>One of the tenants of flat 5 in house number 77 on Bolshoi Prospekt was the teacher <strong>Adolf Rafalovich</strong>. Like the Pevzner family and Yakov Fraiman, Rafalovich was born in <strong>Mogilev</strong>.</p>

    <p>In December 1958, he was arrested and charged under the infamous <strong>Article 58</strong> (“anti-Soviet activity”) for <em>“the storage and distribution of books published abroad, translations from foreign newspapers and magazines, and contact with foreigners (particularly Israeli diplomats).”</em></p>

    <p>In 1959, he was sentenced to <strong>ten years in a prison camp</strong>. <p>The source of this information is Rafalovich's profile in the
<a href="https://ru.openlist.wiki/Рафалович_Адольф_Вениаминович_(1927)" target="_blank">Open List archive of political repressions</a> 
.</p>

    <p> <a href="http://www.chronos.msu.ru/old/RREPORTS/pimenov_vospominaniya_2.html" target="_blank">Rafalovich's trial is also mentioned</a> by famous dissident and zionist activist Revolt Pimenov.</p>
        
    <p> </p>When he eventually returned to Bolshoi 77, <strong>Rimma</strong>, the now-grown daughter of his neighbors, opened the door — and <em>did not recognize him</em>.</p>

    <p>Some years afterwards Adolf Rafalovich immigrated to Israel, becoming part of the so-called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_Soviet_Union_aliyah" target="_blank"><strong>Aliyah of the Seventies</strong></a>. His life stands as a personal example of the <strong>zionist dissident movement</strong> in the post-war USSR.</p>
